Clustered bar charts analyze team performance across match stages, while victory margins are compared through segmented bar charts[#]. Finally, a line chart tracks the trend of runs scored over the years, offering insights into scoring patterns across IPL seasons[#]. These visualizations utilize pre-attentive attributes such as color, length, and positioning to facilitate easy interpretation and comparison of data[#].
